# Exercise 0

Before we start doing all sorts of magic with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s better if we set up a way to learn from our mistakes and store some knowledge for the long run.

We could do this in many ways, like setting up a Wiki, but the best way is to collect all artifacts related to this class in a repository handled through Git and GitHub.


## What’s a repository? 🧐

A repository contains all of your project’s files and each file’s revision history. You can discuss and manage your project’s work within the repository.  
A repository is often called a *repo*.


## What is a commit? 🧐

Committing means that you add, modify, or remove a file from your folder and tell Git to save that change.  
Every commit has a message, a date, and a unique ID (commit hash).


## Is Git the same thing as GitHub? 🧐

Nope 😱  
Git is a **local tool** that tracks changes on your computer.  
GitHub is an **online platform** that hosts your Git repositories remotely for collaboration and backup.


## Steps

### 1. Install Git
Download Git for macOS, Windows, or Linux here:  
👉 https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then open Terminal and configure your details:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
